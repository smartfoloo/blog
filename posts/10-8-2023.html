      <h1>How to Site Rip</h1>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <h5>So, a lot of people have been asking me where I get all of my games. This is like the easiest tutorial ever,
        so let's get started. First, you have to install both Git and Node.js. This is necessary to move on to the next
        step. I'll put the links to both of them down in the resources. The setup process is kinda complicated, so make
        sure you follow the instructions.</h5>

      <h5>
        Next, you gotta click on 
        <a href="https://github.com/EmberNetwork/Blaze" target="_blank"><b style="font-weight: 700;">this</b></a>
        link. The next step is to open Terminal (Mac) or Console (Windows) and run this command: 
      </h5>
      <pre>
				<code>git clone https://github.com/EmberNetwork/Blaze</code>
			</pre>
      <h5>if it gives you an error, you probably don't have git installed. Once the repo is cloned, you can go to your
        Files or Finder app and serach for the <b style="font-weight: 700;">Blaze</b> folder. Once you find it,
        right-click on it and click Open with Terminal or Open with Console. (If I'm wrong on Windows, I'm sorry, idk
        about Windows.) Now, once the window pops up, run the commands </h5>
      <pre>
				<code>npm install</code>
			</pre>
      <pre>
				<code>npm start</code>
			</pre>
      <h5>Once it says the local server is hosted at localhost:5000, open your browser and go to localhost:5000!</h5>
      <h2>How to Use it</h2>
      <h5>To use it, you have to find a webpage that hosts the game FULLSCREEN. It cannot be poki or CrazyGames, since
        they have restrictions on game ripping. Enter the URL of the page, and put the last file after the / on the
        bottom field. To see the files that were downloaded, go to your File Manager app and look for the <b>Blaze</b>
        folder. Double click on that, and look for the <b>Downloads</b> folder. That is where all of your files are. It
        will update every time you rip a new website. </h5>
